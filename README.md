A Python-based board game using Tkinter and Pygame, introducing power tiles (Skip Turn, Instant Capture, Immunity) and dynamic puzzle-based captures (Sudoku, Word Unscramble) with AI-adjusted difficulty, enhancing strategic gameplay for four players. Designed and implemented the AI player logic for the Blue team using a minimax algorithm with heuristic-based decision-making, achieving a 60â€“70% win rate against human players.
